name=opeNoise
description= opeNoise allows to compute the noise level generated by point source or by road source at fixed receiver points and buildings.
about= The plugin allows to compute the noise level generated by point source or by road source at fixed receiver points and buildings.
	Please consider the following condition:
	- geometrical divergence
        - atmospheric absorption ISO 9613-1
        - pure diffraction without ground effects, for horizontal and vertical obstacles 
        - modelization is 3D
